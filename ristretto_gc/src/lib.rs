//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! A pauseless, concurrent mark and sweep garbage collector implementation for the Ristretto VM.
//! This crate provides `Gc<T>` types for garbage-collected references, using a pure reachability
//! analysis algorithm with automatic cycle detection and collection.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! ### üîÑ **Pauseless Concurrent Collection**
//! - **Sub-millisecond pause times** (default: 100 microseconds maximum)
//! - **Concurrent mark-and-sweep** algorithm with reachability analysis
//! - **Background collection thread** that runs alongside application code
//! - **Incremental processing** to maintain low latency
//!
//! ### ‚ö° **Smart Pointer Type**
//! - **[`Gc<T>`]**: Garbage-collected smart pointer with reachability-based collection
//! - **Thread-safe**: Full [`Send`] + [`Sync`] support for concurrent access
//! - **Cycle-safe**: Automatic detection and collection of circular references
//! - **[`Finalize`]**: Optional custom cleanup for objects before deallocation
//!
//! ### üõ†Ô∏è **Configurable Performance**
//! - **Allocation thresholds**: Trigger collection based on memory usage
//! - **Time budgets**: Configurable maximum pause times per collection step
//! - **Step sizes**: Adjustable incremental processing batch sizes
//! - **Concurrent sweeping**: Optional background memory reclamation
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ### Reachability Analysis Algorithm
//!
//! The garbage collector implements a pure reachability analysis with concurrent collection:
//!
//! 1. **Initial Mark Phase**
//!    - Brief pause to mark root objects
//!    - Pauseless for small root sets
//!    - Prepares concurrent marking phase
//!
//! 2. **Concurrent Mark Phase**
//!    - Mark reachable objects concurrently with application
//!    - Incremental processing with configurable time budgets
//!    - Tri-color marking for correctness
//!
//! 3. **Final Mark Phase**
//!    - Brief pause to handle objects modified during concurrent marking
//!    - Processes write barrier notifications
//!    - Ensures marking completeness
//!
//! 4. **Concurrent Sweep Phase**
//!    - Reclaim unmarked objects in background
//!    - Yields regularly to application threads
//!    - Optional concurrent operation
//!
//! ### Tri-Color Marking Algorithm
//!
//! The garbage collector uses the tri-color marking algorithm to ensure correctness and efficiency during concurrent
//! collection. Objects are classified into three colors:
//!
//! - **White**: Unreachable objects, candidates for reclamation.
//! - **Gray**: Reachable objects whose references have not yet been fully scanned.
//! - **Black**: Reachable objects whose references have been completely scanned.
//!
//! During the mark phases:
//! - The collector starts by marking root objects gray.
//! - It scans gray objects, marking their referenced objects gray and turning the scanned object black.
//! - This process continues until no gray objects remain.
//! - At the end, white objects are considered unreachable and are reclaimed during the sweep phase.
//!
//! Tri-color marking, combined with write barriers, ensures that objects modified during concurrent marking are correctly
//! processed, preventing premature reclamation and maintaining application correctness.
//!
//! ### Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **Pause Times**: Sub-millisecond (default 100Œºs maximum)
//! - **Throughput**: Minimal impact on application performance
//! - **Memory Overhead**: Low overhead tri-color marking
//! - **Scalability**: Configurable for different workload patterns
//!
//! ### Thread Safety
//!
//! All operations are fully thread-safe:
//! - Lock-free fast paths for common operations
//! - Safe concurrent collection with proper synchronization
//! - Cross-thread garbage collection coordination
//!
//! ## Safety and Correctness
//!
//! - **Memory Safety**: All operations are memory-safe with no dangling pointers
//! - **Cycle Detection**: Automatic detection and collection of circular references
//! - **Concurrent Correctness**: Proper synchronization for multithreaded environments
//! - **Leak Prevention**: Guaranteed collection of unreachable object graphs
//!
//! ## Integration with Ristretto VM
//!
//! This garbage collector is specifically designed for the Ristretto JVM implementation:
//! - **Low-latency requirements**: Suitable for real-time and interactive applications
//! - **High-throughput**: Minimal impact on JVM bytecode execution
//! - **Memory efficiency**: Compact object representation and fast allocation
//! - **JVM compatibility**: Supports Java memory model requirements
