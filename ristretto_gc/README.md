## Overview

A pauseless, concurrent mark and sweep garbage collector implementation for the Ristretto VM. This crate provides
`Gc<T>` types for garbage-collected references, using a pure reachability analysis algorithm with automatic cycle
detection and collection.

## Features

### üîÑ **Pauseless Concurrent Collection**

- **Sub-millisecond pause times** (default: 100 microseconds maximum)
- **Concurrent mark-and-sweep** algorithm with 4 distinct phases
- **Background collection thread** that runs alongside application code
- **Incremental processing** to maintain low latency

### ‚ö° **Smart Pointer Type**

- **`Gc<T>`**: Garbage-collected smart pointer with reachability-based collection
- **Thread-safe**: Full `Send` + `Sync` support for concurrent access
- **Cycle-safe**: Automatic detection and collection of circular references
- **[`Finalize`]**: Optional custom cleanup for objects before deallocation

### üõ†Ô∏è **Configurable Performance**

- **Allocation thresholds**: Trigger collection based on memory usage
- **Time budgets**: Configurable maximum pause times per collection step
- **Step sizes**: Adjustable incremental processing batch sizes
- **Concurrent sweeping**: Optional background memory reclamation

## Architecture

### Concurrent Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm

The garbage collector implements a sophisticated 4-phase concurrent collection cycle:

1. **Initial Mark Phase**
    - Brief pause to mark root objects
    - Pauseless for small root sets
    - Prepares concurrent marking phase

2. **Concurrent Mark Phase**
    - Mark reachable objects concurrently with application
    - Incremental processing with configurable time budgets
    - Tri-color marking for correctness

3. **Final Mark Phase**
    - Brief pause to handle objects modified during concurrent marking
    - Processes write barrier notifications
    - Ensures marking completeness

4. **Concurrent Sweep Phase**
    - Reclaim unmarked objects in background
    - Yields regularly to application threads
    - Optional concurrent operation

### Tri-Color Marking Algorithm

The garbage collector uses the tri-color marking algorithm to ensure correctness and efficiency during concurrent
collection. Objects are classified into three colors:

- **White**: Unreachable objects, candidates for reclamation.
- **Gray**: Reachable objects whose references have not yet been fully scanned.
- **Black**: Reachable objects whose references have been completely scanned.

During the mark phases:

- The collector starts by marking root objects gray.
- It scans gray objects, marking their referenced objects gray and turning the scanned object black.
- This process continues until no gray objects remain.
- At the end, white objects are considered unreachable and are reclaimed during the sweep phase.

Tri-color marking, combined with write barriers, ensures that objects modified during concurrent marking are correctly
processed, preventing premature reclamation and maintaining application correctness.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Pause Times**: Sub-millisecond (default 100Œºs maximum)
- **Throughput**: Minimal impact on application performance
- **Memory Overhead**: Low overhead tri-color marking
- **Scalability**: Configurable for different workload patterns

### Thread Safety

All operations are fully thread-safe:

- Lock-free fast paths for common operations
- Safe concurrent collection with proper synchronization
- Cross-thread garbage collection coordination

## Safety and Correctness

- **Memory Safety**: All operations are memory-safe with no dangling pointers
- **Cycle Detection**: Automatic detection and collection of circular references
- **Concurrent Correctness**: Proper synchronization for multithreaded environments
- **Leak Prevention**: Guaranteed collection of unreachable object graphs

## Integration with Ristretto VM

This garbage collector is specifically designed for the Ristretto JVM implementation:

- **Low-latency requirements**: Suitable for real-time and interactive applications
- **High-throughput**: Minimal impact on JVM bytecode execution
- **Memory efficiency**: Compact object representation and fast allocation
- **JVM compatibility**: Supports Java memory model requirements
