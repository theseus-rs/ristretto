stdout: === BufferedReader and BufferedWriter Tests ===
--- Basic Buffered Operations Tests ---
Written content with BufferedWriter
File size: 50 bytes
BufferedReader ready: true
First 10 chars: Hello, Buf
Remaining content: 'fered World!
Second line here
Third line'
--- Line Operations Tests ---
Written 6 lines
Line 1: 'First line of text'
Line 2: 'Second line with numbers: 12345'
Line 3: 'Third line with special chars: !@#$%'
Line 4: ''
Line 5: 'Fifth line after empty'
Line 6: 'Last line'
Total lines read: 6
First line: 'First line of text'
Skipped 10 characters
Partial line after skip: 'e with numbers: 12345'
--- Mark and Reset Tests ---
Mark supported: true
Read line 1: 'Line 0: Some test content here'
Read line 2: 'Line 1: Some test content here'
Marked position after reading 2 lines
Read line 3: 'Line 2: Some test content here'
Read line 4: 'Line 3: Some test content here'
Reset to marked position
Read line 3 again: 'Line 2: Some test content here'
Read line 4 again: 'Line 3: Some test content here'
Line 3 matches: true
Line 4 matches: true
